# Robo-Mower

The aim of the project is to create a robotic lawnmower that, in the final stage, would be able to replace a conventional lawnmower with minimal installation work and would not require additional stationary equipment on site (like wires buried in the ground).

The page is stil in progress. Stay tuned for updates in the coming weeks.
